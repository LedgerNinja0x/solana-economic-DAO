# DAO :package: :postbox:

A publicly audited voting system for *Ecoverse* users to select, endorse, and cast votes to support future *Ecoverse* projects. Our developer team will prioritize the implementation of DAO-voted projects to grow and expland the *Ecoverse* dapp.

We developped the DAO using Solana's
 - [SPL-governance](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance) for the backend 
 - [realms.today](https://app.realms.today/realms) for the frontend 

For the MVP of *Ecoverse* we built [this](https://app.realms.today/dao/EkbEAYQeQaftXtwg3cCsoLGbz9qH1dg4aEmkrvkvDZ7g?cluster=devnet) test DAO on Solana devnet.
