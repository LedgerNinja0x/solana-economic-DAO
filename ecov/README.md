# ECOV Token Program :octocat:

This directory contains a **thirdweb** Solana program to mint ECOV token on Solana and to transfer them from a liquidity pool to any other recipient accounts. We built it using the [thirdweb Solana SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/solana) (JavaScript), which leverages the audited Solana [Token Program](https://spl.solana.com/token) standard from the SPL (Solana Program Library).
